        <p>A note from the Founder,</p>
        <p>Having been immersed in the world of 3D printing for several years, I often found myself
          dreading the
          process of setting up new materials on my machine. It wasn't about the cost, but the tedious task of
          calibrating the settings to get it right. While working in the research field for 3D printing, I
          realized the imperative need for a standard calibration system, especially when switching materials.
          This led me to envision a solution that could simplify this process, and AI emerged as a perfect fit for
          the task. The idea of crafting a software that could ease the material switching process was compelling,
          and thus, inTinker was born. This venture has begun with a focus on creating a calibration system for
          switching between printing with different materials, but I see this as just a stepping stone towards
          simplifying the broader spectrum of 3D printing challenges by leveraging AI.</p>
